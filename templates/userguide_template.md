## Suggested Guide Format

### Purpose
Include three to five sentences stating the usage for the guide. Try to answer these questions:

* What is the user trying to do which makes this guide useful?
* What is the expected outcome if the user follows the guide?

### Platform
* Operating System and Version(s)
* Application Platform

For all USER guides, we recommend including multiple options for operating systems, browsers, and common tools.  If you want to submit a USER guide specific to a single operating system or platform (for example: MacOS or Safari Browser), we suggest opening the Issue and asking for contributors to collaborate to cover options available.  

### Guide Steps
Include the lists of the steps to follow the guide.

Try to include detailed information which would help an average technical reader including:
* Code snippets or command line operations
* Dependencies
* Screenshots - limit the screenshots to images which are not easily searched for and / or common usage
  * For common screenshots or clicks
* Link to Videos and Screencaptures

Remember that all information is public domain.  

### Additional References
Include references or additional information.  

*  References should be internet accessible
*  Public domain preferred
*  Try not to reference Blogs, Newspapers, Magazines, or any content with editorial comments
*  Try to reference content with static URLs
